# PrimeTest Project Readme

#### Project Purpose

The PrimeTest project centers around a coding project suitable for python and software devolpment students.   
It involves the design of a simple python module that will test a range of numbers for the presence of prime 
numbers.   While this makes a solid albeit simple coding project, that is not the primary goal of this project.

The use of version control software, such as Git and GitHub, provides tools that greatly simplify the management 
of collaborative software develoment projects and their documentation.   They also form a platform from which 
more advanced software development practices, such as DevOps, for example, can be launched from.

This project aims to provide a solid demonstration of the basic features offered by Git and Github and 
a guide to help new developers learn and explore these tools for themselves.
